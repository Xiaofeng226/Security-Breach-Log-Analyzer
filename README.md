# Security Log Analyzer

**Real-time security event detection and analysis system for identifying threats in system logs**

## 🎯 Overview

A cloud-native, distributed security monitoring pipeline that processes security events at scale. Built to explore endpoint detection and response (EDR) concepts similar to CrowdStrike Falcon's architecture.

The system ingests security logs from multiple sources, processes them through a Kafka event stream, analyzes threats using Go-based microservices, and deploys on Kubernetes for high availability and scalability.
